# rohChain
 the rohun blockchain, in dev, don't get mad that I used to java, golang is harder than it looks.
 
 it will hopefully be a blockchain application that has p2p messaging and transactions. 
 
 the messaging and cryptocurreny are being built in separate branches, once both are functional they will be merged onto the master.
